Support
=======

Getting support
---------------

Item Piles works on any System, but requires setup. The module authors offer support but you should red the `Contributing to Item Piles <https://fantasycomputer.works/FoundryVTT-ItemPiles/#/contributing-to-item-piles>`_ page.

Supported Sytems
----------------

Item Piles supports many Systems already (see `this page <https://fantasycomputer.works/FoundryVTT-ItemPiles/#/?id=natively-supported-systems>`_) but these require some configuration once you activae item piles.

Reporting Issues
----------------

Refer to the Item Piles project `Issue Tracker <>`_ for general reporting. 

The module also uses the `Bug Reporter Module <https://foundryvtt.com/packages/bug-reporter/>`_.
