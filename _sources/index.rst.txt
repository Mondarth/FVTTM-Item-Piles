FoundryVTT Item Piles Module Documentation
==========================================

Item Piles allow you to place (surprise) piles of items on your scenes, but it provides much more than simple piles. You can:

- create containers (e.g. chests, cupboard, graves) that players can open and close. They can be locked too. When opened players can see items contained in the container and take them into their own inventory.
- players can drop items from their inventory, creating a new pile of adding to an existing pile.
- turn tokens into merchants. Item pricing and availability can be conrolled automatically.
- create grid style item vaults
- allow players to trade items directly
